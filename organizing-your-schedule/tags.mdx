#### Not only for Gantt charts
 The power of tags is only realized in a timeline matrix. In Gantt charts, redundancy is necessary, and tags offer little benefit.
</Warning>

Tags can be thought of as one-off, on-the-fly labeling. They work just like hashtags in popular social media posts.

Tags can be added in the `Name` and `description` of the Task.

The advantage of tags is the power they bring. Tags can be added to Tasks and Issues only (no Milestones or Goals). For example, you can create a view of all tasks with certain parameters, plus ones that include or exclude specific tags.

In addition, like Area labels, you can choose to hide #Tags based on the view. For example, if youâ€™re in a view that shows just the tasks with the **`#Paint`** tag, then all the task names will omit the word **`Paint`**, leaving you with task names like `Prime & 1st Coat` and `Final` instead of `Prime **Paint** and 1st Coat` and `Final **Paint**`. This declutters the view without sacrificing explicitness since the reader already knows that all the tasks are Paint-related.
