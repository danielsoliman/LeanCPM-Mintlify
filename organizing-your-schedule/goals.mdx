Goals are yet another way to organize and group your schedule.


Goals serve three purposes:
1. Group related tasks.
2. Provide details for high-level schedules without making them overly complicated.
3. Keep the purpose of each task top of mind.

Goals are an excellent replacement for WBS; like Tasks, they use Areas for grouping and sorting. Goals are the most efficient way of assigning Area labels to tasks.

It is recommended to start most projects by adding Goals before adding Tasks. 

Goals can have start and finish dates that are **independent** of the tasks assigned to them. These dates are used for illustrative purposes only.
