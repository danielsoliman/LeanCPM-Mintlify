title: Work Breakdown Structure
description: LeanCPM is incompatible with WBS.

WBS solves a problem for Gantt charts that doesn’t exist in a Timeline Matrix.

One of the outputs of CPM is a massive task list, known as a Gantt chart.

If designers created design documents like we created schedules, then all disciplines would be on the same drawing, and pages wouldn’t be organized by level or view type. Instead, you’d have to flip to random pages to try to find the area you wanted to see, with small parts of other areas. For example, the label for Level 1 might be located on a different page than the actual design for Level 1.

A Work Breakdown Structure enables you to organize your list of hundreds or thousands of tasks into a hierarchical structure. This is easier for the person creating the schedule, but makes consuming it more difficult.
