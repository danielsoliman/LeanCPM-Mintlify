Issues are items that appear in your schedule but represent off-site work, administrative tasks, or non-value-added activities. They can also refer to resources or external conditions, such as weather.

Some examples of issues:
- Waiting on RFI response
- Re-work
- Submittal Turnaround
- Procurement
- Hurricane Prep
- Waiting on Permit
- Material Delivery

Since issues can be identified early in the planning phases of a project or just before their impacts are realized, they behave differently than Tasks. 

Issues are somewhat in-between Tasks & Milestones. Like tasks they have the following fields:


| Field                | Description                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Status               |                              |
| Expected Date        | early finish; user-generated |
| [Deadline](/terms/milestone#deadlines) | late finish; calculated      |
| Priority             |                              |

## Status

Identified Priority = Successorâ€™s priority  
In progress Priority = Successors Latest Start - Issue Expected Date - 1d

Deadline = Expected Finish
Successors Early Start -1d = Early Finish  
Successors Late Start -1d = Late Finish

WE need an early, expected, and late.? Can be start or finish

Late dates come from successor

==Actual Start = Date created==

If has a predecessor, generate early & late start from blocker, expected start from canvas.

## Who can create issues

The biggest problem with legacy CPM is its lack of collaboration. Schedules are created and managed in a Silo which sews distrust and distaste, sparking the Lean movement which is a rejection of CPM.

Whomever is ultimately responsible for the project should also be responsible for the plan. Allowing anyone to create or delete tasks or dependencies doesn't support that notion. 

However, subcontractors need a way to identify issues that prevent them from starting, proceeding with, or finishing work. Therefore, anyone can create issues. However, only the plan owner can accept or reject issues. 

## Dependency requirement

To crate an issue, it must be blocking an task or another issue.

This requirement is necessary to calculate priority and early and late dates.
