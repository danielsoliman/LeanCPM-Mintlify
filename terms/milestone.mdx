In LeanCPM, a milestone is a significant point or event in a project that marks the completion of a major deliverable or phase. It represents a clear checkpoint in the project timeline and is used to track progress and ensure that the project stays on schedule. Milestones have zero duration.

Milestones play a more significant role here than they do in legacy CPM. 

> Milestones are used to calculate the early and late dates for tasks and issues.

## Substantial Completion

This milestone is a part of every project and represents the point at which the project should be completed.

## Dependencies
Since Milestones represent a point in time when something can or will start or finish, they can only be in series with issues or tasks.

<Note>
#### Legacy CPM
 Remember, an “in series” dependency is just like a Finish-to-Start (FS) relationship in legacy CPM.
</Note>

This means that milestones cannot occur concurrently with their dependencies.

## Target Dates

Like tasks, milestones have target dates that the planner manually sets. These dates are used in the schedule calculation and thus drive the Early and Late dates for their dependencies.

## Early and Late Dates

Since milestones are used to set early and late dates for tasks, their early and late dates must be calculated differently.

In essence, these are the exact early and late dates from legacy CPM.

## Deadlines

Deadlines are different than Target dates. While Target dates represent your near-term objectives, Deadlines represent the project’s goals, typically defined at the project’s inception or after a significant change resets expectations (e.g., an approved change order that alters the project’s end date).

Deadlines are not used in schedule calculations; they are provided for reference purposes.

Deadlines should fall between the early and late dates.

### Why deadlines instead of late dates?

It makes sense that the latest possible date for a milestone is the deadline. However, the late dates (and early dates) are calculated based on the “Substantial Completion” Milestone

## Start Milestone

Start Milestones occur the day after their blockers are finished, and the same day as their blocked task's start.


These have the following fields:


|                  | Early Start | Target Start | Late Start | Early Finish | Target Finish | Late Finish | Deadline |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Start Milestone  | ✅           | ✅            | ✅          |              |               |             | ✅        |
| Finish Milestone |             |              |            | ✅            | ✅             | ✅           | ✅        |

## Types

Types are an optional field for Milestones. We recommend software vendors ship their applications with some pre-defined fields. This allows organizations to track the progress of their projects compared to other projects.

Some potential default milestone types:
- NTP (Notice to Proceed)
- Construction Start*
- Foundations Complete
- Top Out (Superstructure complete)
- Permanent Power
- Permanent Air
- Dry In
- Substantial Completion*
- Turnover
- Inspection

Each milestone should be of just one type, however each type should be allowed to be used more than once.
