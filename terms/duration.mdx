We continue to use the CPM definitions. There are 3 durations:

## Target Duration 

This is the duration manually set by a planner, its the anticipated number of days the task will be worked on from start to finish. Excludes non-working days (like weekends and holidays) and doesn't anticipate any issues. The Anticipated Duration cannot be changed after the task as Started.

## Days on Task

The number of days between the Actual Start and Actual Finish, if the Task hasn't finished yet then its the number of days between the Actual Start and Today. If there is no actual start, then this value is 0.

## Days to Finish

The number of days between today and Actual Finish. If the task hasn't started yet, it'll be the number of days between Actual Start and Actual Finish. If the task is finished then this value is 0.

## Actual Duration
