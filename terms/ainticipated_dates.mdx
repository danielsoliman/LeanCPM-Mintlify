These are AI-generated dates that utilize a combination of historical performance, current status, and anticipated completion dates of all unfinished blockers, along with any relevant comments, photos, or activity associated with related tasks.

<Warning>
#### Caution with AI

AI is non-deterministic. For example, in 10 different scenarios, you could have all inputs the same, but the AI could generate 10 different outputs. 
</Warning>

<Note>
#### Change the anticipated finish manually
To change the anticipated finish, add a comment like this: “We think we’ll finish around Friday, April 11” or “starting on Monday”. The AI will read this, understand, and adjust the date(s) accordingly. 

It’s essential to note that the comment is not the only input; for example, if a comment was made months before the task began, you may find that the anticipated dates do not match exactly, as many inputs are considered.
